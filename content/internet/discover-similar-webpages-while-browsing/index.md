Are you researching a topic on the internet?

Want to find webpages similar to the page you are currently looking but not able to come up with the right search query on Google?

Google launched new extension for Chrome to find related webpages called “Google similar pages beta”.You can preview and explore other pages with one click.Install the extension from <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-similar-pages-beta/pjnfggphgdjblhfjaphkjhfpiiekbbej?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon" target="_blank">here&nbsp;</a>.

After installing go to any webpage and click on similar button,It will displays a pop up with similar pages(up to four pages) as shown below.

<a href="https://arun-arungudellicom.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GoogleSimilarPages.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-431" title="GoogleSimilarPages" alt="GoogleSimilarPages" src="https://arun-arungudellicom.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GoogleSimilarPages-300x187.jpg" width="300" height="187" srcset="https://arun-arungudellicom.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GoogleSimilarPages-300x187.jpg 300w, https://arun-arungudellicom.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GoogleSimilarPages.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>

As mentioned earlier it’s a beta version,it has some limitation like

<ul><li>only four pages we can see.</li><li>And sometimes if you are viewing a particular post in a blog&nbsp;<a href="https://www.arungudelli.com/2012/09/interesting-facts-about-google.html">https://www.arungudelli.com/2012/09/interesting-facts-about-google.html</a>. It may not show similar webpages but the domain <a href="https://www.arungudelli.com" target="_blank">https://www.arungudelli.com</a>&nbsp;may show related pages.</li><li>And one more thing I noticed that if we are viewing youtube,it will shows similar pages as facebook,myspace,yahoo,hotmail rather than video sharing sites like metacafe,dailymotion,vimeo.</li></ul>
