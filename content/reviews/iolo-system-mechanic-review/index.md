### <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Iolo System Mechanic Review:</em></span>

Here I am sharing my experience with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>System mechanic.</em></span>

It’s straight forward and easy to use tool.

When I installed <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>System Mechanic</em></span>, updated it and loaded it for the first time, this is the screen I got. Easy to read with clear instructions and A nice “dashboard” giving me a summary of my system performance.First time It’s poor.

Simply I clicked on Repair All button it took almost 20 min to clean my system. It altered some start up settings and some other things, it required a restart.



When I restarted before windows could fully load, System mechanic loaded in DOC command line and ran through its scan there (Cleaned some disk problems).

It took several minutes, Windows7 loaded this time I ran system mechanic and it showed system status as Green.

My computer was noticeably faster. Start up to an active desktop was a bit faster, applications loaded a little faster, websites came up faster.<br>
I went to system mechanic dashboard to see what actually it did here is the screen shot(Reports&gt;History)

{{< figure src="SystemmechanicHistory.png" title="System Mechanic History" alt="System Mechanic History" >}}

But one thing I noticed here is it said “Fixed registry problems” but no further information like what problems it fixed? “Recovered 605 MB of memory” how it recovered? No details Information.

Apart from this it is very good at the back-end cleaning.

Do I recommend System Mechanic? Yes. It provided some in depth improvements to my system that I am very lazy to do. I found that it’s a great time saver.

<strong><em>Is it worth to spend 49$ per year?(50% off to my readers)</em></strong>



For advanced power users it’s just another tool may not be worth at $49 per year. But it’s great tool for cleaning your family members (Mom’s Dad’s Son’s or daughter’s) systems. One copy of system mechanic can be installed in any number of sytems. <em>Overall $49 really not much for some really useful software like this.</em>
