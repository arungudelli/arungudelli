In this post I will explain how to access Facebook on any mobile without internet or GPRS connection.

Now a days everyone(even school students) using smart phones like apple,android,windows etc but there are still some people who would like to use classic mobiles like Nokia 1100 I am one of them.

Right now I am using Nokia 1280 mobile.I cannot access Internet from my mobile. I am getting bored while travelling.

But luckily I found a way to access <a href="https://www.arungudelli.com/2012/12/must-have-facebook-feature-definitely-you-will-love-it.html" target="_blank">Facebook</a> on my mobile.Shocked?

Yes There is a way to access Facebook from any mobile that has no&nbsp;connectivity like GPRS/EGDE/3G.

Just dail *325# (or *fbk#) from your mobile.No need of Internet &nbsp;GPRS. Here is the quick tour.

<a href="https://arun-arungudellicom.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/FaceBook-without-Internet.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-560 aligncenter" title="FaceBook without Internet" alt="FaceBook without Internet" src="https://arun-arungudellicom.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/FaceBook-without-Internet.png" width="410" height="679" srcset="https://arun-arungudellicom.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/FaceBook-without-Internet.png 410w, https://arun-arungudellicom.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/FaceBook-without-Internet-181x300.png 181w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px"></a>

Dial *325# and provide your username and password that’s it.You can update your status instantly chat with your friends who are online,add new friends,read notifications etc.

But you may feel difficulty in reading stories one by one.But still it’s a good service to use.If you don’t have internet connectivity.

<em><strong>How to Use It?</strong></em>

There are so many shortcuts available I have been playing with them.

Post on friends Timeline:*325*3#<br>
Facebook Chat: *325*33#<br>
Birthday Reminder: *325*76#<br>
Status Juggler: *325*75#

Add new friends by phone number

Just dial &lt;<strong>*325*friend’s mobile number#&gt;&nbsp;</strong>to add new friends on Facebook, instantly!

For Example: To Add Me type &nbsp;*325*8197551028#

<em><strong>Is It Free?</strong></em>

It’s a service provided by fonetwish. Updating your status is completely free, but using other features, such as posting on a wall, checking notifications, and adding friends is not free. Facebook by Fonetwish is a subscription service that charges Rs. 1/- day for unlimited usage.

Not only Facebook you can connect twitter,<a href="https://www.arungudelli.com/2012/08/track-who-opened-your-mails-yesware.html" target="_blank">Email</a>(Yahoo,gmail,hotmail).First 15 days free of cost. And after that per day 1 rupee. Dial *325# and select combo offer (which include facebook,twitter,Emails).

Currently it’s available on networks like&nbsp;Airtel, BSNL,Vodafone,Tata,Uninor,Aircel, Idea, Reliance,Videocon, Loop mobile and Tata Docomo in India,Most of the networks are covered.To unsubscribe dial *325*22#.

<em><strong>I have smart phone why to use this service?</strong></em>

Even though you have smart phones, when you stuck in remote areas where there is no internet or no other form of data like GPRS what you will do? Still you can access Facebook without <a href="https://www.arungudelli.com/2012/09/interesting-facts-about-google.html" target="_blank">Internet</a> and you can connect with your friends at a reasonable price.And no additional roaming charges.Just 1 rupee per day.

You can connect your mobile from Facebook account also.
