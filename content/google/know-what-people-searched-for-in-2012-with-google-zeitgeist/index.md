<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>What is Google Zeitgiest?</strong></em></span>

Even I am also confused what is Zeitgiest? German word ,It means&nbsp;<strong>spirit of the age</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>spirit of the time.&nbsp;</strong>i.e., which&nbsp;influences the world over the period of time.Now your clear right why Google took this name.Google started this service in 2001.

But this time with more <a href="https://www.arungudelli.com/2012/10/the-best-google-features-you-are-probably-not-using.html" target="_blank">features</a> and also with Maps and <a href="https://www.arungudelli.com/2012/10/find-whatever-you-want-with-google-image-search.html">Images</a>.And filtered according to countries,languages.

Gangam Style second most trending topic all around the world.I loved this song.Whitney Houston is number One.

These are the some trending topics around the world in 2012 I found from <a href="http://www.google.com/zeitgeist/2012/" target="_blank">Google Zeitgeist</a> You can download entire list from <a title="GoogleZeitgeist" href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.google.com/en//zeitgeist/2012/download/google-zeitgeist-2012-en.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.Ipad &nbsp;is the only keyword which holding it name in TOP10 from 2010.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Google Zeitgeist 2012 In India:</strong></em></span>

This time I was shocked with the results&nbsp;Sunny Leone&nbsp;is the third most keyword searched in India.While IBPS and Gate Exam are first two.Salman khan’s Ek tha tiger fourth.

Aakash tablet and Jabong(.)com are in the Top 10.

When coming to people no doubt in that right again Sunny leone.Two more bollywood stars are in the TOP 10 Poonam Pandey(3rd place And in 2011 4th place she is the only one holding her name in TOP10 when compared to last year 2011) and&nbsp;Sherlyn Chopra(6).

Anna hazare and Sachin lost their place from TOP10.

And also Teenager Alia Bhatt(Student of the year) daughter of Mahesh Bhatt is in 4th Place.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>See The Past 10 year trends:</strong></em></span>

I tried to gather Past 10 year trends, You can see these Google Zeitgeist lists from 2001 onwards from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/zeitgeist/" target="_blank">here</a>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>How Google Zeitgeist gather data?</strong></em></span>

All the searches Google studied are anonymous. No personal information was used.Google gathered these data from multiple sources including Google Trends. Trending topics are “the searches that had the highest amount of traffic over a period in 2012 as compared to 2011.” While&nbsp;The “most searched” queries are the most popular terms for 2012—ranked in order of the queries with the largest volume of searches.
