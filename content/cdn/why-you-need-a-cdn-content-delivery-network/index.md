You might heard about Content Delivery Network or CDN, This post will explains what exactly is this Content Delivery Network? What kind of problem it solves? Whether you should use <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CDN(Content Delivery Network)</span> or Not?

There’s a glass ceiling to web performance. Once you’ve gone through every line of code on your website, paring down the three data-intensive areas that will slow down responsiveness – images, JavaScript, and CSS – you know there’s nothing else you can do. So, what do you do?

<b>It’s Not Your Fault</b>

In a successful evolutionary path, a website will reach a point of popularity where the single source of its server simply can’t keep up with the growing demand of customers.

It becomes a physical barrier.

Magnify that by the distance from your server by customers, and you fully begin to see why you can’t solve this problem by yourself. It all comes down to one inescapable fact: the slowest thing a website can do is make the requests for files from servers across the internet. If they’re coming from one place – and that place is thousands of miles away, or even on the other side of the planet, latency will cause a frustrating degradation of your website’s performance.

<b>Send in the Clones</b>

Your single server populating the entire Internet just won’t cut the mustard once you reach a certain level of viewers. Add intricate functionality such as e-commerce and you’ll feel the slowdown even more.

That’s when it’s time to enhance your server with the global infrastructure of <em><strong>a Content Delivery Network (CDN)</strong></em>.

The average Internet user may not realize it, but much of today’s web content is delivered not by a company’s single web server, but by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Content Delivery Networks</span> (CDNs). This is a service that takes your website’s images, JavaScript, and CSS (the data-intensive elements of a webpage) and clones these assets across a network of servers around the planet. This removes the physical distance barriers that cause latency – the three types of files named above (which often are the largest in size) are delivered from a server that’s closest to each of your customers.

Popular websites not using a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CDN(Content Delivery Networks)</span> earn the wrath of frustrated customers when their website’s page doesn’t load quickly. It doesn’t matter that the real reason has little to do with the website itself, but the physical distance separating the server and the customer. The website still gets blamed. Physical distance will add complete seconds to the load time of a web page.

A CDN solves this problem by populating the static elements of your website in multiple places.

### The MaxCDN Content Delivery Network&nbsp;Solution:

Now that you know you need a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CDN(Content Delivery Networks)</span> to solve your latency problems, you should be looking for one that has true global reach – a CDN such as MaxCDN (<a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-7253632-11373479" target="_blank">Learn more about MaxCDN</a><img alt="" src="https://www.lduhtrp.net/image-7253632-11373479" width="1" height="1" border="0">). This Content Delivery Network features a worldwide distribution of no less than 500 peering partners that establish a direct reach into nearly 100 countries.

You benefit from this in a big way because your customers are connecting to your website with just a single network hop, and that means your page load times can dramatically decrease from hundreds of milliseconds to only tens.

There’s an additional and very real benefit from MaxCDN’s use of Anycast DNS, which allows multiple, identical globally deployed DNS servers to use the same IP address so that your content can exist in hundreds of places around the world simultaneously.

These powerful assists are the main reasons why over 13,000 customers from around the world have come to MaxCDN for help in punching through the latency barrier to quickly reach their customers. You’ll recognize these companies: among them are Black &amp; Decker, TNW, StumbleUpon, and Nissan.

### Highly Affordable&nbsp;Content Delivery Networks:

It wasn’t long ago that only the big players could afford the services of a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CDN(Content Delivery Networks)</span>. Today, it’s a necessary and surprisingly affordable investment that puts the power of many servers in many locations, creating a large number of short connection points between your content and your customers.

How affordable is “surprisingly”? Monthly pricing actually starts at just $9 for a basic package – and depending on your bandwidth requirements, that $9 basic package might just be all you really need. MaxCDN recently rolled out <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-7253632-11373479" target="_blank">new lower monthly fees</a><img alt="" src="https://www.lduhtrp.net/image-7253632-11373479" width="1" height="1" border="0"> for what they’re calling, “Instant Awesomeness.”

As long as your files are under 10 megabytes, MaxCDN will host an unlimited number of them on its worldwide infrastructure. You’re simply paying for bandwidth usage – and MaxCDN has a suite of new lower monthly fees <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-7253632-11373479" target="_blank">bandwidth plans</a><img alt="" src="https://www.lduhtrp.net/image-7253632-11373479" width="1" height="1" border="0"> to mesh with your requirements.

What happens if you exceed your bandwidth allocation under the plan you’ve selected? MaxCDN gives you the option to either pay for the overage – or if you need to step up – upgrade to a better fitting package. Either way, it amounts to only having to pay for the least amount possible. Plans and pricing really are affordable – especially if you take advantage of <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-7253632-11373479" target="_blank">this link</a><img alt="" src="https://www.awltovhc.com/image-7253632-11373479" width="1" height="1" border="0"> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Use Coupon Code “max20”</strong></span>.
