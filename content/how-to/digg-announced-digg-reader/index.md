Now bloggers are thinking about replacement to Google Reader, but bloggers may lose their &nbsp;subscribers because only some people will migrate their RSS readers to other platforms and many of them are ignore(lazy) as they don’t want to take much time or effort to migrate their feeds.

Now the discussion has been started what is the alternative for Google Reader?

Currently we have plenty of options like Feedly,Pulse,Flipboard,Newsblur,Netvibes&nbsp; and&nbsp;the old reader.

But in the meanwhile social bookmarking giant DIGGannounced their New Reader alternative to Google Reader.As per DIGG blog It’s planned to build a reader in the second half of 2013 but after announcement of Google’s it took it as a high priority and announced it’s launching date as JULY 1 2013.
