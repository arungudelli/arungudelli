“Green is good” seems to be the marketing phrase that everyone is currently trying to sell. When we look back in time, we will have most likely adopted sustainable practices to the point where we will have forgotten the point (now) when these practices, that we are just beginning to understand and become aware of, were n’t natural…Perhaps a bit like thinking of living without a cell phone.

More and more, people are making more sustainable choices when it comes to purchases and industries are being held responsible for their actions and choices. No one likes to sacrifice quality, but in a world that is quickly shifting to function more sustainable, the sustainable option is the one that is frequently being sought out by consumers.

Now all of us, at any <a href="https://www.webcreationuk.co.uk/">web design company</a>, join the cause <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Sustainable Web Design</em></span>

## Should I make my website sustainable?

Many people think of the aviation industry when it comes to environmental footprints…they figure they’ll fly a little less or check the box to pay a few extra dollars to plant trees in place of their travel. News flash! The internet’s yearly carbon footprint has exceeded that of the aviation industry and is quickly growing. At 1114K (2012 statistic), the average webpage has tripled in size since 2008 and is about 15 times larger than 10 years ago (<a href="http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/average-web-page/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/average-web-page/</a>).<br>
So what is the goal of sustainable web design? Carbon footprint reduction. It’s that simple and it really is simple. Other benefits, aside from avoiding adding to the world’s carbon pollution, are: a faster site, a site that converts more easily on mobile phones and better SEO!
