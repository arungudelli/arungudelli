In this post I will explain how to identify fake Facebook profiles.

The problem with the social networking sites is Fake profiles.Some times it’s difficult to find out fake profiles.Today I tried one simple Google trick to identify Fake Facebook profiles.

Just follow the following tips

<ul><li>Download the profile pic.</li><li>And go to Google Image search</li><li>Upload that profile pic into Google Image search.</li></ul>







That’s it.It will displays all webpages which contain that profile pic.I tried with more than 20 profiles and more than 90% of them are fakes.You can refer my older posts&nbsp;<a href="https://www.arungudelli.com/2012/10/find-whatever-you-want-with-google-image-search.html" target="_blank">Use Google Image Search Smartly</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.arungudelli.com/2012/09/search-google-by-image.html" target="_blank">Search Google By Image</a>&nbsp;to know more about Google Image Search.
